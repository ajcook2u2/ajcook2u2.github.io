        <h3 class="business-case-title">Business Case - How should we reallocate our marketing funds?</h3>
        <p>In many cases, companies need to decide how to spend their marketing funds towards the tactics that will maximise their returns.
            However, this process can get quickly muddied, as it can be hard to compare different tactics when they are being overseen by different teams, using completely 
            seperate platforms. Having analysis seperated from any specific platform with a bird's eye view of all tactics therefore becomes necessary to remove siloing and bias
            and manage funds in a more unified way, tying the team together under a single, more efficient budget.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>In order to achieve this, I have used the Robyn MMM package. Fitting prior synthetic spend data broken out by tactic and sales over time will generate models with
            response curves which can be used to forecast what the most optimized allocation will be in this hypothetical case study.
        </p>
        <h3>Model Selection</h3>
        <p>After generating a selection of models, I am selecting Model 5_86_3, which I will from here on refer to simply as 'Model'. I am selecting this model as it has the highest 
            r2 with both the test and validation set, as well as tighter confidence intervals for the CPA by tactic. 
        </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Reallocation</h3>
        <p>Now that a model has been selected, I can use the projected response curve to reallocate funds to maximise sales. In this sample case, the reallocation is 
            projected to lead to an additional 5k sales.
