      <h3>Business Case - What factors are affecting Customer Interests</h3>
      <p>Many times, companies would like to know what their customers are thinking. While such desires are impractical, understanding their interests and what affects them is 
        a good runner up. If these trends are analyzed and understood, they-and by extension the customers-can be predicted.
      </p>
      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>For this case study, I used Google Trends data as a stand-in for customer interest and pulled in various factors in order to analyze possible correlations with 
        interest in Travel.
