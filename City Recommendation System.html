      <h3>Business Case - City Recommendation System</h3>
      <p>While most companies don't have a direct interest in knowing what cities they might like, being able to pull information from the internet and then analyze and 
        visualize it dynamically can fill many business needs. This project does exactly that.
      </p>
      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>By using various APIs and webscraping, when the user gives a city, they will recieve a list of cities that they might like to explore, based on similar factors
        such as population density and climate.
